# Week1:

## Introduction To Java

1.1 The Basics of Java Program, Variables, Data Types & Comments

What I've learnt from the class today.

1. Basic of Java Program Sturcture.

2. Variables

3. Data Types
    
    a. Data Types Implicit Conversion
    
    b. Type Casting

4. Comments

    In computer programming, comments are a portion of the program that are completely ignored by Java compilers. They are mainly used to help programmers to understand the code.

    Types of comments

        // Single Line Comment
    
        /* Multiline comment */

1.2 Java Operators, Taking User Input

What I've learnt today

* Java Operators
    
    1. Arthematic Operators
    2. Assignment Operators
    3. Relational Operators
    4. Logical Operators


* User Input

    
1.3 Java Conditional Statements

* Java if-else statements
    
    The if statement executes a certain section of code if the test expression is evaluated to true.

    Statements inside the body of else block are executed if the test expression is evaluated to false. This is known as the if-...else statement in Java.

* Java if - else if - else statements

    In Java, we have an if...else...if ladder, that can be used to execute one block of code among multiple other blocks.

* Nested if-else statements

    In Java, we have an if...else...if ladder, that can be used to execute one block of code among multiple other blocks.

* Java Ternary Operator

    A ternary operator evaluates the test condition and executes a block of code based on the result of the condition.

    The ternary operator can be used to replace certain types of if...else statements.

        condition ? expression1 : expression2;
